# Turbofan-RUL-Prediction
Developed a predictive maintenance model leveraging regression and time-series analysis to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbofan engines using NASA’s C-MAPSS dataset. The project enhances reliability and performance in industrial systems through data-driven predictions.
